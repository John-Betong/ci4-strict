Welll, the cyan on black for the "current page" on the side has legibility issues, and is a bit of an eyesore. The use of red and yellow on the landing page is also a bit of a wonk.

The use of inline style is also not that great, but I've never built a page ON Github so I have no idea who much that limits what you can do or where you can put things.

In that way, the heading order is all banjaxed making it hard to alternative navigate.... though I think that is due to broken markup structure -- like lacking a BODY tag, and the first heading on the page being a H2... which how can you have a H2 before the H1?

Content-wise though you're doing ok. Each page feels a bit sparse for me, I'd probably condense -- but keep in mind the way I like to do things most people scream "AAAH!!!! WALL OF TEXT!".

I really like your part about treating warnings as errors. With some languages these days -- HTML and CSS in particular -- invalid markup is damned near by design given how off the wall the W3C has gotten, but with a "real" language like PHP those excuses don't exist, and "warnings" can very quickly becomes "this code doesn't run anymore".

Take for example mysql_ functions, which we were told for FIFTEEN YEARS were going away, and even now there are people going "huh, what?", and even more who make up lame half-assed excuses for staying with buggy, insecure, and outmoded versions of PHP just BEGGING to be pwned.

It's why -- even in HTML/CSS -- if I violate a rule I like to document it if anyone else is going to touch the codebase. Once comment saying "yes, this causes a warning, BUT" can go a long ways towards helping the next poor sod to deal with the code.

But even better if you can do it WITHOUT the warning, HUFFING DO IT!!! That's the big problem. If there's a legitimate reason like having no alternative for a browser you're required to support, comment it! But if you CAN do it the right way, fix the bloody issue.

Far too many developers go "oh it's just a warning" and walk away without even trying. That part of your very first page gets a big thumbs-up from me!
